operating structure, industry associations, revenue model etc.

For-Profit Model
External/Outsourced Training Provider
The education and training capacity offered through various 
schemes currently are inadequate to meet the demand of the large 
percentage of unskilled workers in the Indian labour market. The 
Construction Skills Training Institute 
education system is often not delivering the required number of 
specialists across project management, engineering, surveying, 
Construction Industry Development 
contract management and the skilled/semi-skilled labor. 
Council 
National Academy of Construction 
The NSSO findings also reconfirmed that over 97% of individuals 
between 15 and 65 have no exposure to any training. So the 
National Institute of Construction 
imminent need is to expand the reach of training providers, set up 
Management and Research 
models and institutes with the capability to scale. 
Near absence of formal training and skill certification systems and institutions & over 
reliance on conventional sourcing of manpower.
A perceptible reduction of share of new trainees in Construction Engineering Streams 
(Civil, Electrical, & Mechanical Engineering) with a  lack of interest of Institutions to 
raise intake levels
Lack of adequate number of skilled contractors for the existing number of projects
Organizations especially PSU’s have recommended setting up a few contractors’ 
training institutions.  
v
Govt. and industry body to  Government should give incentives to private players for letting the training providers
incentivize and promote use their assets for training.
collaborative training  Industry Body should ensure that there is a market for collaboration and use of scarce
capital resources. For e.g. there could be a network of employers who commit to
train a certain percentage of their workforce and tie-up with training providers for the
same making it commercially viable for the training providers.
Financial assistance to be  Corporate sponsored apprenticeship-where the organization bears the training
offered to trainees expenses.
 Providing scholarships/grants to a certain percentage of trainees
 Workers could be provided an interest free loan to afford their training expenses.
National level certification and  Government should develop a nationally recognized  framework for qualification and
accreditation body should be set- also work with industry to ensure that the qualification framework is recognized.
up  A system of ‘Graded Certification’ depending upon levels of proficiency achieved
with a seamless integration with the Higher Education programs should be enforced.
Govt. should enforce conditions  Pre-qualification process in selection of contractors with a focus on the quality of
on manpower quality and manpower supplied should be strictly enforced and should form a part of contractual
certification while selecting EPC agreements
contractors  Govt. should  enforce Labor inspection framework to audit major EPC projects by
government/private players for upholding minimum labor standards/quality
Industry should foster  and  Industry players and training bodies should initiate steps to develop strong linkages
nurture strong linkages with which would serve their collective interest and provide mutual support. This linkage
Training providers could help the industry in overcoming skill shortage and improving productivity and
would help the institutes in various ways like content development, low fixed

Real estate in India is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors at a CAGR of 10 percent in the last five years. It
is expected to expand at a CAGR of 19 percent in the next five years. The sector contributed to 4.8 percent of the
total GDP of the nation in 2012-13. Industry estimates valued the Indian real estate sector to be INR 4551 billion in
2012-13 and is projected to reach INR 13,250 billion by 2023. By 2025 the sector is expected to generate employment
for more than 17 million individuals in the country. Projected levels of urban and rural housing shortage , expansion
plans of offices within Tier-II and Tier-III cities, increasing consumerism in retail sector, growing hospitality
infrastructure and tourism will drive the demand for this sector.
Infrastructure segments constitutes more than 40 percent of the construction sector and expected to be
valued at over INR 4774 billion by 2017 and INR 8674 billion by 2023. With over 1000 PPP projects in the country at
an estimated project cost of about US $97 billion in the pipeline, infrastructure sector in India is poised for
tremendous growth momentum in the years ahead.
25
Construction
The segment witnessing significant growth with supply pipeline of more than 3.5 billion sq.ft lined up for
completion by 2013. According to estimates of the taskforce on Rental housing, the urban population in India is
expected to shoot up from 377 million in 2011 to 590 million by 2030. Even at current population levels, urban
housing shortage is estimated to be more than 29 million. 76 percent total housing shortage arises from Uttar
Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,
Karnataka and Gujarat.
Decline in supply of new housing units maintained the demand–supply gap allowing developers to raise prices.
Slow GDP growth, high interest rates, a weak job market and high property prices have forced buyers to
postpone their decision to buy residential property, hitting investor driven housing demand.

The demand for affordable housing in the country is largely insulated against the slowdown. Government programmes lie
Indira Aawaas Yojna, Rajeev Gandhi Aawaas Yojna, Two Million Housing Programme, will boost the demand for
residential real estate investments in the forthcoming years. This indicates that the labour requirement for construction of

Rapid growth in the IT/ITeS service sectors is driving the demand for commercial office spaces in the country. Large
untapped customer base, low cost manpower is attracting a large number of Multinationals to set up operation in
different regions in India. Occupiers are also looking to shift to cost-effective locations in the suburbs, while leading
IT/ITeS occupiers continue to expand.
Though the commercial segment traditionally concentrated towards CBD (Central Business District) areas in large cities,
the need for huge office space by the IT/ITeS companies has led to the evolution of secondary business district (SBD)
model leading to multiple developments in city outskirts and suburban regions like Gurgaon, Electronic City, Bandra and
Malad etc. Instead of having several small office at multiple locations, occupiers are focusing on relocating and
consolidating. More than 445 million sq. ft of real estate development is planned in the office space across 10 major
cities with NCR and Bengaluru regions itself accounting for more than 53 percent. This will drive the demand for labour.

Growth in investments in Indian Industry will be driven by strong capacity additions from SEZs. This means,
this segment is expected to grow in the coming years.100% FDI is permitted in real estate projects within
SEZs. Thus, SEZs are emerging as an extension of real estate business. The government has brought down
the minimum land requirement from 1000 hectares to 500 hectares for multi-product SEZ and for sector
specific SEZs to 50 hectares. As of March 2013, 577 SEZs have been formally approved by the Government
of India.

India has the second largest road network in the world for a length of 4.7 million kilometres. The Government
of India aims to develop 66117 kilometres of roads under various schemes such as National Highway Development
Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme in North East (SARDP-NE) and Left Wing Extremism
(LWE.). The budget outlay for road transport and highways increased at a robust CAGR of 19.4 per cent between FY09
and FY14. This points toward the potential demand for road construction labour in India.

It has a total route network of about 64,600 kilometres (of which 29.98 per cent is double/multi-track) spread
across 7,146 stations. Demand for urban mass transport coupled along with increased FDI flows are the key
drivers of demand and thereby skilled labour.
India is ranked as the 9th largest civil aviation market globally with more than 50 airports and 1188 aircrafts in
operation. The aviation market in India is poised to become the 3rd largest in the world by 2020. As on 2012 the airports
in India handled more than 162 million passengers recording a 14 percent growth compared to the previous fiscal year
The aviation market is booming with growth opportunities due to evolution of low cost air fares and rising incomes of
the middle class population in India. Freight traffic has also registered an unprecedented growth registering a CAGR of
over 8.3 percent during the period 2006-12. Over 2.26 million tonnes of freight traffic is handled by Indian airports during
2012 of which more than 65 percent are international freight

India has more than 13 major ports- 6 on the eastern coast and 7 on the western coast and 200 minor ports as on 2012. 
During FY13, 29 projects are scheduled to be executed adding capacity of 208 MTPA at the cost of USD 8.8 billion. Port 
based SEZs are being set up in places like Mundra, Krishnapatnam, Rewas and few others to provide strategic 
advantage to industries within these zones. 
Under National Maritime Development Programme (NMDP), a total of 251 projects comprising of construction of new
berths to rail/road connectivity with an investment outlay of USD 11.8 billion have been identified. In 2013, government
has set a target for creation of 250 million tonnes of capacity spread across 42 projects at an estimated cost of USD 2.8
billion.
Under the National Maritime Agenda 2010-2020, port infrastructure is to be developed to implement full mechanisation
of cargo and two major ports and two hub ports will be developed.
The proposed outlay for port sector in 12th Five year plan, excluding private investment is USD 4.7 billion. Thus, Ports
are going to expand and upgrade in capacity and infrastructure which will lead to increased demand of labour.

India is the fifth largest producer and consumer of electricity in the world. With growing industrialisation fuelling
economic growth over the coming years, power demand will experience a strong boost. In the 12th Five year plan, the
government targets a capacity addition of 89 GW and around 100 GW under the 13th Five year plan. Investments of
around USD 223.9 billion are planned for the power sector during 12th Plan. Existing inefficiencies in the power sector
namely significant demand-supply gap, high AT&C losses, peak demand deficit require immediate attention to meet the
requirements of the future without shortfall. in order to address the existing shortfalls in the system and to efficiently
meet the projected energy needs of the future, the 12th plan has envisaged investments in highly advanced modern
supercritical technology. A total investment of more than Rs 13,72,580 crores is envisaged under the 12th Plan to the
power sector in various key areas. Renewable energy is also set to grow with capacity additions of 30 GW planned over
the next five years.

Based on the interactions and meetings with the leading Engineering & Construction players in the country, we have come up 
with a set of critical profiles which currently faces enormous skill shortage. Some of these profiles are highly skilled and 
require only skilled professionals, and there are some for which the skill training need not be intensive, but the number of 
people to be trained is large.
Some of those critical profiles include:
The profiles of welders and fitters under the mechanical trades are critical to the success of any 
Mechanical Trades: construction project. The welders profile especially is considered to be a very skilled profile with 
Welders and Fitters a strong emphasis on recruiting trained/experienced welders.
Both the profiles are under acute shortage of skilled people given the huge requirement.

Foremen understanding the drawings and design related aspects. Both the Foremen and Supervisors are in 
acute shortage in the current scenario.
Operators could be any type of machine operator, for e.g. Motor Grade operator, Crane operator 
et.al. The requirement of operators has been rising of late given the advancements in technology 
Operators and the higher degree of mechanization the construction projects are undergoing. There is an 
acute quantity problem and over the period of time, these skills would be required in far more 
number.
These kinds of profiles are niche in the sense they are mainly required for a certain sector

Issues in attracting/  Untrained people mostly at the entry level
retaining talent  No or  little aspiration among the youth to get trained in this sector .  In terms of being
a preferred sector it faces stiff competition from  retail and security sector since they
do not require as much hard labour
Skills premium – The skill premium seems to be absent, mostly there is no recognition for trained 
correlation to manpower since the unskilled manpower is available aplenty and costs less

Lack of regulatory framework or Industry requirements to impose certain percentage of

 One of the biggest issue in this sector is  the unskilled labour  force often come from
Migrant nature of 
agriculture sector. The farmers come into construction in non seasonal times or when
labor
the crops are bad, or when the family  is in financial crises. These people get skilled
but when the scenario changes in the agriculture sector they go back and comes back
to construction after 1-2 years, these people have to be skilled again and again.
Institute needs to re-skill the same set of people who come from agriculture sector
 Most of the labour force are migrants. They are usually from states such as WB,
Orissa, UP, Bihar and Assam and they migrate mostly to southern states such as Kerala
and Karnataka where they get relatively higher wages than their home states

There are different types of training models currently prevailing in the country viz. a)Sponsored/Funded (Corporate adopted) 
Model, b)Industrial Captive Training Centres, c) PPP model for training, d) For-Profit Model and e)External/ Out-sourced 
Training Provider Model. They differ in terms of their sizes, operating structure, industry associations, revenue model etc.

Shortage of talent in the construction sector is a long term problem and will continue to push up project costs and 
risks.The education and training capacity offered through various schemes currently are clearly inadequate to meet the 
demand of the large percentage of unskilled workers in the Indian labour market. The education system is often not 
delivering the required number of specialists across project management, engineering, surveying, contract management 
and the skilled/semi-skilled labor. 
The NSSO findings also reconfirmed that over 97% of individuals between 15 and 65 have no exposure to any training. So 
the imminent need is to expand the reach of training providers, set up models and institutes with the capability to scale.
